**Project: CI/CD Workflow with GitHub Actions**

**Overview:**
In this project, I developed a **fully automated CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** to deploy a dynamic web application. The workflow integrates **Docker**, **AWS ECS Fargate**, and several AWS services to deliver a streamlined, scalable, and secure deployment process. I implemented variables throughout the project to enhance flexibility and reusability, and leveraged GitHub Marketplace to integrate additional tools that extended the project's capabilities.

**Deployment Steps:**

1. **GitHub Secrets:**
   - Configured **GitHub Secrets** to securely store sensitive credentials such as **AWS access keys**, **RDS endpoint**, and SonarCloud token**, preventing hardcoding and enhancing 
     repository security.
